###Useful tips:
<ol>
<li>createCanvas(width,height)- creates a place for you to draw</li>
<li>rect(x,y,width,height)</li>
<li>ellipse(x,y,r1,r2)</li>
<li>line(x1,y1,x2,y2)</li>


<li> strokeWeight() - Increases the width of the lines, like using a thicker painbrush.</li>

</ol>
###Hacks I want to try:
<ol>
<li> Remember making a circle using a scale when we were kids? Yes, let's try that.</li>
</ol>
